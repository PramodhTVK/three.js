# Thread-It #

- An *AI Powered* 3D Shirt Designer Web App.
- 3D Model for the T-Shirt was created on Blender and imported as a glb file(GLB is the binary version of GLTF).
- *valtio* was used to maintain intitial state of the T-Shirt.
- **Three.js** library was used for rendering the meshes in real time onto the screen.
- This web app has three features :-
     - Users can upload any file of their choice and render it as the texture for the shirt.
     - Users can change the colour of the Shirt. This was implemented using *SketchPicker* from ***react-color*** module.
     - Users can leave texture generation to **DALL-E**.All they have to do is enter the necessary prompts.
- The first two features are up and running. The last feature is currently being worked on.
