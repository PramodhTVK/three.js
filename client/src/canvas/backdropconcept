AccumulativeShadows: This component is provided by @react-three/drei and enables the accumulation of shadows in a scene. It enhances the shadow rendering capabilities by allowing multiple shadow-casting objects to contribute to the overall shadow map, resulting in more realistic and accurate shadows. To use AccumulativeShadows, you would typically wrap your scene with this component.

RandomizedLight: This component is also provided by @react-three/drei and allows you to create randomized light effects in your scene. It generates random positions, colors, and intensities for the light source, creating dynamic and ever-changing lighting scenarios. You can use this component to add variation and visual interest to your Three.js scenes.

The behavior of shadows changing as you rotate a 3D object is a result of the way shadows are calculated and rendered in a 3D scene. When you enable shadows in a scene, the renderer analyzes the position and geometry of light sources and objects in the scene to determine how shadows should be cast and displayed.By default, when you rotate a 3D object, the lighting and shadow calculations are automatically updated to reflect the new position and orientation of the object. This is because the rendering engine takes into account the relative positions of the light source, the object, and other objects in the scene to calculate how shadows should be cast and displayed.
